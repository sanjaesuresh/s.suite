# claude-code-toolkit

A private, portable Claude Code setup: reusable **skills**, **subagents**,
**hooks**, **safety guardrails**, and **project templates** that turn Claude Code
into a *team of specialists* — product, engineering, design, security, QA, and
release — instead of one generic assistant.

It is designed to be **safe**, **reusable**, and **work-safe**: usable on
personal projects and inside an employer environment (e.g. Bloomberg) **without
encoding any proprietary information**.

## What this is

- **Global, generic tooling** lives in `global/` and installs into `~/.claude`.
- **Project-specific** context stays in each repo's own `CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/`.
- **Local/private** settings (`settings.local.json`, credentials, saved context)
  are never committed and never synced into this repo.

## Inspiration (not a dependency)

The role-based structure is inspired by Garry Tan's open-source
[`gstack`](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) — the strongest ideas borrowed:
role-based specialists, plan-before-implementation, a skeptical pre-merge review
culture, `careful`/`freeze`/`guard` safety hooks, context save/restore, health
checks, and Diataxis docs.

This toolkit **does not depend on gstack** and does not clone it. It is simpler,
private, and hardened for work use:

- ~22 skills + ~17 agents, all plain markdown — no external binaries, no telemetry,
  no analytics directory, no required browser automation.
- Every reusable file is generic; nothing proprietary is ever persisted globally.
- Safety hooks are minimal and "careful, not annoying" (confirm, don't block).

You do **not** need to install gstack. Recommended: keep this toolkit standalone.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanjaesuresh/claude-code-toolkit.git
cd claude-code-toolkit
bash bootstrap.sh                  # copy mode (default, safe everywhere)
# or: bash bootstrap.sh --symlink  # symlink mode (personal machines)
```

Windows (PowerShell, copy mode only):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/sanjaesuresh/claude-code-toolkit.git
cd claude-code-toolkit
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\bootstrap.ps1
```

Install copies `CLAUDE.md`, `settings.json`, `skills/`, `agents/`, and `scripts/`
into `~/.claude`, makes scripts executable, **backs up** anything it overwrites
(`~/.claude/.toolkit-backups/<timestamp>/`), and **never** touches
`settings.local.json` or credentials.

> Symlink vs copy: **copy is the default** because some corporate environments
> dislike symlinks. Use `--symlink` only on machines you control.

## Sync across machines

On each machine after the first:

```bash
cd claude-code-toolkit
bash scripts/sync.sh               # git pull --ff-only + re-install (copy mode)
bash scripts/sync.sh --symlink     # ...symlink mode
bash scripts/sync.sh --no-pull     # re-install without pulling
```

## Verify the install

```bash
bash scripts/validate-claude-config.sh        # checks ~/.claude
bash scripts/validate-claude-config.sh --repo # checks this repo's global/
```

## Using the workflows

Invoke any skill by `/name` (or just describe the task — descriptions are written
so Claude auto-invokes the right one).

### Plan first

| Command | Role | Use it to |
|---|---|---|
| `/office-hours` | Founder/mentor | Challenge a product idea before building |
| `/spec` | — | Turn vague intent into a precise, executable spec |
| `/implementation-plan` | — | Scoped plan + risks before any code |
| `/product-plan-review` | Product/founder | Review a feature plan (expand / hold / cut) |
| `/engineering-plan-review` | Eng manager | Architecture, failure modes, tests, rollout |
| `/design-plan-review` | Designer-coder | Score a UX plan, find the 10/10 |

### Pre-PR review (the centerpiece)

```
/pre-pr-review
```

Strict, **read-only** review of your current diff: task completion, scope creep,
AI slop, correctness, tests, security, and production-risk bugs that pass CI.
Ends with a verdict, a prioritized issue list, test gaps, a suggested PR
description, and a final checklist. It recommends specialist follow-ups
(security, tests, architecture, scope) when warranted. For a fresh second
opinion, the `pre-pr-reviewer` subagent runs the same review in isolation.

### Learn a codebase

```
/learn-codebase how does auth work here
```

Reads the real implementation and teaches it: 30-second explanation, code map,
the main call flow, key data, edge cases, what the tests prove, and how to change
it safely. The `codebase-teacher` subagent does the same in an isolated context.
For whole-repo orientation use `/onboarding-map`.

### Deep audit

```
/deep-codebase-audit current diff
```

Fans out the relevant specialist subagents in parallel and synthesizes one
report with the top issues to fix first — and what *not* to churn.

### Safety: careful / freeze / guard

```
/careful            # warn + confirm before destructive shell commands
/freeze src/auth    # block edits outside src/auth this session
/guard src/auth     # careful + freeze together (max safety)
/unfreeze           # lift the freeze   (or: bash ~/.claude/scripts/unfreeze-edits.sh)
```

These are enforced by global `PreToolUse` hooks. Safe cleanups
(`rm -rf node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, ...) pass through silently. The freeze
lock prevents accidental `Edit`/`Write` outside scope — it is not a security
boundary (Bash can still write anywhere).

### Context save / restore

```
/context-save       # save task, decisions, git state, remaining work (project-local)
/context-restore    # resume and reconcile with current git state
```

Saved context defaults to `.claude/context/current-session.md` (gitignored,
project-local). It scans for secrets/PII first and **warns before writing**.
Work context is **never** synced into this toolkit or global memory.

### Health & ship

```
/health-check       # lint/typecheck/test/build score + top fixes
/pr-description     # PR description from the diff + validation
```

## Add a new skill or agent

Paste the relevant template prompt into Claude Code:

- New skill: `templates/create-new-skill.prompt.md`
- New agent: `templates/create-new-agent.prompt.md`

Each asks the right questions and tells you whether it should be **global** (put
it in `global/skills` or `global/agents` here) or **project-specific** (put it in
the repo's `.claude/skills` or `.claude/agents` — or stage it under
`templates/project-skills` / `templates/project-agents`), and whether it is safe
for work repos.

## Global vs project-specific

- **Global** (this repo → `~/.claude`): generic skills/agents/instructions that
  apply everywhere. Must contain **no** project or employer specifics.
- **Project** (a repo's own `CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/`): everything specific to
  that codebase. A project `CLAUDE.md` **overrides** the global one on conflict.
- Use `templates/project-claude.md` and `templates/project-settings.json` as
  starting points for a new repo.

## Work / Bloomberg safety rules

Read this before using the toolkit at work.

- **Never persist proprietary/work information into global files** — not into
  `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, global skills/agents, saved contexts, generated docs, or
  this toolkit repo.
- Do **not** copy internal code, repo/service names, internal URLs, logs, stack
  traces, screenshots, secrets, or proprietary architecture into any reusable file.
- In a **work repo, rely only on that repo's local `CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/` and
  the current session** for project context.
- `context-save` and `docs-generate` default to **project-local, gitignored**
  files and scan for secrets/PII before writing.
- The global `CLAUDE.md` already encodes these rules so every session honors them.
- **Check your employer's policy** before installing third-party tooling or
  enabling hooks on a work device.

### What must never be committed (here or anywhere)

`settings.local.json`, `.credentials.json`, `.claude.json`, `.env*`, any secrets
or tokens, saved session context, and anything project/employer-specific. The
`.gitignore` enforces the obvious cases, but treat it as a backstop, not a license.

## Test the setup

1. `bash scripts/validate-claude-config.sh --repo` — structure + JSON + frontmatter.
2. Install into `~/.claude`, then `bash scripts/validate-claude-config.sh`.
3. In a throwaway personal repo, try: `/office-hours`, `/spec`,
   `/engineering-plan-review`, `/pre-pr-review`, `/learn-codebase <topic>`,
   `/careful`, `/freeze <path>` then try editing outside it (should be blocked),
   `/unfreeze`, `/context-save` then `/context-restore`, `/health-check`.
4. Confirm a dangerous command (e.g. `git reset --hard`) prompts for confirmation
   and that `rm -rf node_modules` does not.

## Recommended rollout order

1. Create the private repo.
2. Add global `CLAUDE.md`.
3. Add safety skills: `careful`, `freeze`, `guard`.
4. Add `pre-pr-review` skill.
5. Add `learn-codebase` skill.
6. Add `pre-pr-reviewer` agent.
7. Add `codebase-teacher` agent.
8. Add `scope-guardian`, `ai-slop-detector`, `security-reviewer`, `test-strategist`.
9. Add planning skills: `office-hours`, `spec`, `product-plan-review`,
   `engineering-plan-review`, `design-plan-review`.
10. Add the bootstrap script.
11. Test on a personal repo.
12. Only then install on a work device — **after checking internal policy**.
