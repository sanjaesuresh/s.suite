# claude-code-toolkit

A private, portable Claude Code setup: reusable **skills**, **subagents**,
**hooks**, **safety guardrails**, and **project templates** that turn Claude Code
into a *team of specialists* — product, engineering, design, security, QA, and
release — instead of one generic assistant.

It is designed to be **safe**, **reusable**, and **work-safe**: usable on
personal projects and inside a corporate/employer environment **without
encoding any proprietary information**.

## What this is

- **Global, generic tooling** lives in `global/` and installs into `~/.claude`.
- **Project-specific** context stays in each repo's own `CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/`.
- **Local/private** settings (`settings.local.json`, credentials, saved context)
  are never committed and never synced into this repo.

Invoke anything by `/name`, or just describe the task — every description is
written so Claude auto-invokes the right one.

> **Lean defaults:** 11 rarely-used, redundant, or superseded skills ship **off**
> in `settings.json` to save context tokens. The 8 documented ones are marked ⊘
> below; `test-driven-development`, `verification-before-completion`, and
> `executing-plans` are also off (superseded by `software-engineer` /
> `subagent-driven-development`) and not separately listed. They're not deleted —
> flip any back on under `skillOverrides` (`"spec": "on"`) when you want them.

## Skills (42)

**Plan & scope**

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/brainstorming` | Explore intent, requirements, and design through collaborative dialogue — mandatory gate before any creative or build work. |
| `/kickoff` | Front door for new work: ticket/feature → branch (work) → investigate the codebase → ask only the decision-altering questions (with pros/cons) → scoped plan. No code. |
| `/writing-plans` | Produce a comprehensive implementation plan in plain English (file-per-task, behavior, tests) before touching code. |
| `/office-hours` | Challenge a product idea like a founder-mentor before any planning. |
| `/spec` ⊘ | Turn vague intent into a precise, executable spec with a clear definition of done. |
| `/implementation-plan` ⊘ | Research the area and produce a scoped plan (lighter than `kickoff`; no branch/ticket flow). |
| `/product-plan-review` ⊘ | Review a feature plan through a product/founder lens (expand / hold / cut). |
| `/engineering-plan-review` | Review a plan like an eng manager: architecture, failure modes, tests, rollout. |
| `/design-plan-review` | Review a UX/frontend plan; scorecard + what a 10/10 looks like. |
| `/plan-pipeline` | Run a plan through eng + design (+ scope/migration) reviews in one pass; auto-decide routine calls, surface only taste decisions. |

**Build**

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/software-engineer` | The default build/fix loop: understand → plan → implement in small steps → verify with evidence → self-review. Orchestrates the specialists. |
| `/frontend-engineer` | The build/fix loop for **web UI**: brief-first design (so it doesn't look AI-generated) + engineering gates — WCAG 2.2 a11y, Core Web Vitals, every-state coverage, semantic HTML, tokens, production-readiness (SEO/CSP/images/CI). Bundles a CI scanner for AI design tells. |
| `/using-git-worktrees` | Set up an isolated workspace via native tools or git worktree before starting feature work or executing a plan. |
| `/dispatching-parallel-agents` | Fan out 2+ independent tasks to specialized agents running concurrently in separate contexts. |
| `/subagent-driven-development` | Execute an implementation plan with independent tasks in the current session by dispatching them as concurrent subagent waves. |
| `/finishing-a-development-branch` | After tests pass, present structured options for merge, PR, or cleanup and execute the chosen integration workflow. |

**Research**

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/researcher` | Multi-source, fact-checked web research: clarifies an underspecified question, fans out parallel `deep-researcher` workers, adversarially verifies the load-bearing claims, and synthesizes a cited report with a confidence/gaps section. Effort-tiered (`--quick` / `--deep`) so trivial questions don't spawn a fleet. |

**Review & audit** (read-only)

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/pre-pr-review` | Strict, skeptical review of your current diff before opening a PR. |
| `/learn-from-review` | Turn a PR review comment into a durable toolkit rule (in CLAUDE.md, a skill, or an agent) so the same mistake isn't repeated. Logs to `LESSONS.md`. |
| `/deep-codebase-audit` ⊘ | Multi-agent deep audit of a repo, feature, folder, or diff. |
| `/test-gap-analysis` ⊘ | Find missing, weak, or misleading tests in code or a diff. |
| `/ai-slop-cleanup` ⊘ | Find (and optionally fix) AI slop, overengineering, dead code, fake robustness. |
| `/pr-description` | Generate a PR description grounded in the real diff + validation performed. |
| `/ci-watch` | Check CI status for the current PR, tail failing job logs, and propose (not auto-apply) a fix — read-only by default. |
| `/release` | Collect real commits from git log since the last tag, draft a changelog and semver bump, then propose a tag — nothing pushed without explicit confirmation. |
| `/standup` | Mine recent git, PRs, and blocker signals into a short, human-sounding Yesterday/Today/Blockers script to say in standup. |

**Debug & refactor**

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/debugging-incident-review` ⊘ | Investigate a bug/incident methodically — root cause before any fix. (Off: superseded by `/systematic-debugging`.) |
| `/systematic-debugging` | Investigate any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior by tracing root cause before proposing any fix. |
| `/safe-refactor-plan` | Plan a refactor safely: tests first, small commits, rollback path. |
| `/split-commit` | Review the working tree and split it into focused commits (feature / fix / refactor / docs / chore). Proposes the grouping and waits for approval; commits only — never pushes or branches. |

**Understand & document**

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/learn-codebase` | Deep-dive a part of THIS codebase and teach it from real code and call flows. |
| `/onboarding-map` ⊘ | Generate an onboarding map for an unfamiliar repo. |
| `/docs-generate` | Generate/update docs from actual code (Diataxis: tutorial / how-to / reference / explanation). |
| `/health-check` | Run/propose lint, typecheck, tests, build, dead-code, dependency checks; score + top fixes. |

**Safety & session**

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/careful` | Warn + confirm before destructive shell commands this session. |
| `/freeze <path>` | Restrict edits to one directory/path this session. |
| `/guard <path>` | `careful` + `freeze` together (max safety). |
| `/context-save` | Save task, decisions, git state, and remaining work to a project-local file. |
| `/context-restore` | Restore saved context and reconcile it with the current git state. |

## Agents (19)

Subagents you (or a skill) can delegate to. **All are read-only except
`software-engineer` and `frontend-engineer`**, the two with edit/write tools. The
`deep-researcher` additionally reaches the public web (WebSearch/WebFetch) and
has read-only Bash for fetching sources — it never edits the repo. The
deeper-reasoning agents run on `opus`; the rest on `sonnet`.

**Implementers (write-capable)**

| Agent | What it does |
|---|---|
| `software-engineer` ⚙️ | Delegatable implementer for a well-scoped build/fix, end to end. Never commits or pushes unless you explicitly ask. |
| `frontend-engineer` ⚙️ | Delegatable implementer for a well-scoped **web UI** build/fix: deliberate not-AI-looking design + a11y/CWV/state/production-readiness engineering, end to end. The browser-facing counterpart to `software-engineer`. |

**Product & design**

| Agent | What it does |
|---|---|
| `founder-reviewer` | Challenge a product idea like a founder/CEO; find the stronger and the smallest useful version. |
| `product-strategist` | Turn a vague idea into a user problem, positioning, requirements, and MVP scope. |
| `design-reviewer` | Review UI/UX plans or frontend diffs; scorecard across hierarchy, a11y, states, consistency. |

**Engineering review**

| Agent | What it does |
|---|---|
| `engineering-manager` | Review a plan for architecture, data flow, edge cases, state transitions, tests, delivery risk. |
| `architecture-reviewer` | Review module boundaries, dependency direction, abstractions, naming, pattern fit. |
| `pre-pr-reviewer` | Strict PR-readiness second opinion on a diff. |
| `scope-guardian` | Review a diff for scope creep; classify each change; suggest a PR split. |
| `ai-slop-detector` | Flag AI slop, overengineering, dead code, fake error handling, style inconsistency. |
| `test-strategist` | Find missing tests; propose unit/integration/regression/edge-case tests. |

**Risk & ops**

| Agent | What it does |
|---|---|
| `security-reviewer` | Review for security/privacy/auth/injection/secrets risks (OWASP + STRIDE thinking). |
| `migration-risk-reviewer` | Review DB/schema/config/API migrations for rollout, rollback, and compatibility risk. |
| `release-manager` | Go/no-go ship readiness: git state, tests, docs, rollout, rollback, monitoring. |
| `qa-reviewer` | Build manual test plans, edge-case plans, and regression plans. |
| `health-checker` | Run/recommend health checks; produce a score and prioritized fixes. |

**Understand & debug**

| Agent | What it does |
|---|---|
| `codebase-teacher` | Explore the repo and teach a feature/subsystem from real code. |
| `debugger` | Investigate bugs via a hypothesis tree — no fixes without investigation. |

**Research**

| Agent | What it does |
|---|---|
| `deep-researcher` | Read-only web research worker: investigates ONE sub-question with WebSearch/WebFetch and returns structured, source-backed findings. The `/researcher` skill fans out several of these in parallel. |

## Inspiration (not a dependency)

The role-based structure is inspired by Garry Tan's open-source
[`gstack`](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) — the strongest ideas borrowed:
role-based specialists, plan-before-implementation, a skeptical pre-merge review
culture, `careful`/`freeze`/`guard` safety hooks, context save/restore, health
checks, and Diataxis docs.

This toolkit **does not depend on gstack** and does not clone it. It is simpler,
private, and hardened for work use:

- 42 skills + 19 agents, all plain markdown — no external binaries, no telemetry,
  no analytics directory, no required browser automation.
- Every reusable file is generic; nothing proprietary is ever persisted globally.
- Safety hooks are minimal and "careful, not annoying" (confirm, don't block).

You do **not** need to install gstack. Recommended: keep this toolkit standalone.

`scripts/statusline.sh` renders the Claude Code status bar: active model name, context window usage (%), cumulative session cost in USD, and session duration (e.g. `[claude-sonnet-4-5] 42% context | $0.18 | 12m`).

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanjaesuresh/claude-code-toolkit.git
cd claude-code-toolkit
bash bootstrap.sh                  # copy mode (default, safe everywhere)
# or: bash bootstrap.sh --symlink  # symlink mode (personal machines)
```

Windows (PowerShell, copy mode only):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/sanjaesuresh/claude-code-toolkit.git
cd claude-code-toolkit
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\bootstrap.ps1
```

Install copies `CLAUDE.md`, `LESSONS.md`, `skills/`, `agents/`, and `scripts/`
into `~/.claude`, makes scripts executable, and **backs up** anything it overwrites
(`~/.claude/.toolkit-backups/<timestamp>/`). `settings.json` is **deep-merged**
into any existing `~/.claude/settings.json`, preserving your `plugins`, `theme`,
and `env` values. Note that leaf arrays inside toolkit-managed objects (such as `permissions.deny`, `permissions.ask`, and `hooks.PreToolUse`) are replaced on every sync, so any custom entries you add there will be overwritten — put those customizations in `settings.local.json` or a project-level settings file instead. `~/.gitignore_global` is wired into `git config --global
core.excludesfile` so toolkit-managed ignores apply everywhere. Install **never**
touches `settings.local.json` or credentials.

> Symlink vs copy: **copy is the default** because some corporate environments
> dislike symlinks. Use `--symlink` only on machines you control.

## Sync across machines

On each machine after the first:

```bash
cd claude-code-toolkit
bash scripts/sync.sh               # git pull --ff-only + re-install (copy mode)
bash scripts/sync.sh --symlink     # ...symlink mode
bash scripts/sync.sh --no-pull     # re-install without pulling
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd claude-code-toolkit
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\sync.ps1
```

## Verify the install

```bash
bash scripts/validate-claude-config.sh        # checks ~/.claude
bash scripts/validate-claude-config.sh --repo # checks this repo's global/
```

## Using the workflows

Invoke any skill by `/name` (or just describe the task — descriptions are written
so Claude auto-invokes the right one).

### Build something (the default loop)

```
/software-engineer
```

The everyday engineering loop: understand → plan → implement in small steps →
verify with evidence → self-review before declaring done. It's the orchestrator
that pulls in the specialists below at the right moments and holds scope tight.
Use it when you're actually building or fixing and no more specific skill fits.

There's also a matching **`software-engineer` subagent** — a delegatable,
write-capable implementer for a well-scoped task you want carried out in its own
context, and a **`frontend-engineer` subagent** that does the same for web UI.
These two are the only agents with edit/write tools; the rest are read-only
reviewers. Active `freeze`/`careful` hooks still apply to them.

### Plan first

| Command | Role | Use it to |
|---|---|---|
| `/kickoff` | Tech lead | Ticket/feature → branch → investigate → ask only what matters → plan |
| `/office-hours` | Founder/mentor | Challenge a product idea before building |
| `/spec` ⊘ | — | Turn vague intent into a precise, executable spec |
| `/implementation-plan` ⊘ | — | Scoped plan + risks before any code |
| `/product-plan-review` ⊘ | Product/founder | Review a feature plan (expand / hold / cut) |
| `/engineering-plan-review` | Eng manager | Architecture, failure modes, tests, rollout |
| `/design-plan-review` | Designer-coder | Score a UX plan, find the 10/10 |

### Pre-PR review (the centerpiece)

```
/pre-pr-review
```

Strict, **read-only** review of your current diff: task completion, scope creep,
AI slop, correctness, tests, security, and production-risk bugs that pass CI.
Ends with a verdict, a prioritized issue list, test gaps, a suggested PR
description, and a final checklist. It recommends specialist follow-ups
(security, tests, architecture, scope) when warranted. For a fresh second
opinion, the `pre-pr-reviewer` subagent runs the same review in isolation.

### Learn a codebase

```
/learn-codebase how does auth work here
```

Reads the real implementation and teaches it: 30-second explanation, code map,
the main call flow, key data, edge cases, what the tests prove, and how to change
it safely. The `codebase-teacher` subagent does the same in an isolated context.
For whole-repo orientation use `/onboarding-map`.

### Deep audit

```
/deep-codebase-audit current diff
```

Fans out the relevant specialist subagents in parallel and synthesizes one
report with the top issues to fix first — and what *not* to churn.

### Safety: careful / freeze / guard

```
/careful            # warn + confirm before destructive shell commands
/freeze src/auth    # block edits outside src/auth this session
/guard src/auth     # careful + freeze together (max safety)
/unfreeze           # lift the freeze   (or: bash ~/.claude/scripts/unfreeze-edits.sh)
```

These are enforced by global `PreToolUse` hooks. Safe cleanups
(`rm -rf node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, ...) pass through silently. The freeze
lock prevents accidental `Edit`/`Write` outside scope — it is not a security
boundary (Bash can still write anywhere).

### Context save / restore

```
/context-save       # save task, decisions, git state, remaining work (project-local)
/context-restore    # resume and reconcile with current git state
```

Saved context defaults to `.claude/context/current-session.md` (gitignored,
project-local). It scans for secrets/PII first and **warns before writing**.
Work context is **never** synced into this toolkit or global memory.

### Health & ship

```
/health-check       # lint/typecheck/test/build score + top fixes
/pr-description     # PR description from the diff + validation
```

## Add a new skill or agent

Paste the relevant template prompt into Claude Code:

- New skill: `templates/create-new-skill.prompt.md`
- New agent: `templates/create-new-agent.prompt.md`

Each asks the right questions and tells you whether it should be **global** (put
it in `global/skills` or `global/agents` here) or **project-specific** (put it in
the repo's `.claude/skills` or `.claude/agents` — or stage it under
`templates/project-skills` / `templates/project-agents`), and whether it is safe
for work repos.

## Global vs project-specific

- **Global** (this repo → `~/.claude`): generic skills/agents/instructions that
  apply everywhere. Must contain **no** project or employer specifics.
- **Project** (a repo's own `CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/`): everything specific to
  that codebase. A project `CLAUDE.md` **overrides** the global one on conflict.
- Use `templates/project-claude.md` and `templates/project-settings.json` as
  starting points for a new repo.

## Work / employer safety rules

Read this before using the toolkit at work.

- **Never persist proprietary/work information into global files** — not into
  `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, global skills/agents, saved contexts, generated docs, or
  this toolkit repo.
- Do **not** copy internal code, repo/service names, internal URLs, logs, stack
  traces, screenshots, secrets, or proprietary architecture into any reusable file.
- In a **work repo, rely only on that repo's local `CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/` and
  the current session** for project context.
- `context-save` and `docs-generate` default to **project-local, gitignored**
  files and scan for secrets/PII before writing.
- The global `CLAUDE.md` already encodes these rules so every session honors them.
- **Check your employer's policy** before installing third-party tooling or
  enabling hooks on a work device.

### What must never be committed (here or anywhere)

`settings.local.json`, `.credentials.json`, `.claude.json`, `.env*`, any secrets
or tokens, saved session context, and anything project/employer-specific. The
`.gitignore` enforces the obvious cases, but treat it as a backstop, not a license.

## Test the setup

1. `bash scripts/validate-claude-config.sh --repo` — structure + JSON + frontmatter.
2. Install into `~/.claude`, then `bash scripts/validate-claude-config.sh`.
3. In a throwaway personal repo, try: `/office-hours`, `/spec`,
   `/engineering-plan-review`, `/pre-pr-review`, `/learn-codebase <topic>`,
   `/careful`, `/freeze <path>` then try editing outside it (should be blocked),
   `/unfreeze`, `/context-save` then `/context-restore`, `/health-check`.
4. Confirm a dangerous command (e.g. `git reset --hard`) prompts for confirmation
   and that `rm -rf node_modules` does not.

## Recommended rollout order

1. Create the private repo.
2. Add global `CLAUDE.md`.
3. Add safety skills: `careful`, `freeze`, `guard`.
4. Add `pre-pr-review` skill.
5. Add `learn-codebase` skill.
6. Add `pre-pr-reviewer` agent.
7. Add `codebase-teacher` agent.
8. Add `scope-guardian`, `ai-slop-detector`, `security-reviewer`, `test-strategist`.
9. Add planning skills: `office-hours`, `spec`, `product-plan-review`,
   `engineering-plan-review`, `design-plan-review`.
10. Add the bootstrap script.
11. Test on a personal repo.
12. Only then install on a work device — **after checking internal policy**.
